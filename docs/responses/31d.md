Let's analyze the given SAT practice question and the choices provided to find the most logical transition:

**Question:**
Researchers Helena Mihaljević-Brandt, Lucía Santamaría, and Marco Tullney report that while mathematicians may have traditionally worked alone, evidence points to a shift in the opposite direction. _______ mathematicians are choosing to collaborate with their peers—a trend illustrated by a rise in the number of mathematics publications credited to multiple authors.

Choices:
- A) Similarly,
- B) For this reason,
- C) Furthermore,
- D) Increasingly,

**Explanation:**
The sentence structure shows a contrast between past behavior ("traditionally worked alone") and a new trend ("shift in the opposite direction"). The transition word should logically connect this shift to the increasing number of collaborations.

**Analyzing Each Choice:**

- **A) Similarly:** This word indicates a comparison to something mentioned earlier, suggesting that two situations are alike. However, we are looking for a word which indicates an increasing trend. The past behavior (working alone) and the new behavior (collaborating) are not similar, so "Similarly" does not fit here.

- **B) For this reason:** This phrase is used to indicate a cause-and-effect relationship. However, the sentence structure doesn’t present a cause-effect scenario but rather a shift from one mode of operation to another. Therefore, "For this reason" isn’t the best fit.

- **C) Furthermore:** This transition word is used to add information or to introduce an additional point. The sentence in the question adds more information about the shift in behavior, so it fits well contextually. 

- **D) Increasingly:** The student's choice would roughly match the logical direction of the sentence since "Increasingly" can convey that mathematicians are choosing to collaborate more often. However, it seems redundant here because the sentence already states a rise in collaborative works. Transition words should create a logical flow, and while "Increasingly" could fit, it doesn't transition or link the information as effectively as "Furthermore."

Given these options, **C) Furthermore** completes the sentence with the most logical transition, adding to the point already made and enhancing the logical flow of the statement.

### Why the Student Might Have Chosen `d`:
Your student chose `D) Increasingly`, which suggests a trend of more collaboration. While this is not inherently incorrect in meaning, it doesn’t serve as the best transition word for the reasons previously explored. Students sometimes favor choices that seem to match the content of the clause directly but ignore how well they function as transitions in the context of the entire passage.

Thus, the correct answer is **C) Furthermore.**
