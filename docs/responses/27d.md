Certainly! Let's analyze the sentence and the answer choices to understand how to get the correct answer and why answer choice `d` is incorrect.

The sentence reads:
"In 1943, in the midst of World War II, mathematics professor Grace Hopper was recruited by the US military to help the war effort by solving complex equations. Hopper’s subsequent career would involve more than just _______ as a pioneering computer programmer, Hopper would help usher in the digital age."

To complete this text in a way that conforms to the conventions of Standard English, we need to ensure proper punctuation and coherence between the clauses.

First, let's break down the sentence structure and examine how each option fits:
- **A) equations, though:** 
  This option attempts to join the two ideas using a comma and "though." However, "though" as a conjunctive adverb needs to be separated by a comma if it is to introduce a contrasting idea in the middle or at the end of the second clause, which is not the case here. Therefore, while not entirely incorrect, it doesn't provide the best structure.

- **B) equations, though,**
  This option correctly places "though" between two commas, creating an interrupting modifier. This matches the conversational tone and provides a clear contrast, making it the ideal punctuation.

- **C) equations. Though,**
  This option incorrectly uses "though" after a period. Typically, "though" is not used to start a sentence in this manner because it creates a fragment. The second part of the sentence "Though, as a pioneering computer programmer, Hopper would help usher in the digital age" is incomplete on its own.

- **D) equations though**
  This answer choice lacks the necessary commas to separate the interrupting modifier "though," and as a result, fails to provide clarity in the sentence structure and the contrasting idea.

The correct answer is **B) equations, though,** because it correctly punctuates the sentence by using commas to set off the interrupting modifier "though." It separates and clarifies the transition from Hopper's immediate task during the war to her long-term contributions.

### Why the Student Might Have Chosen `d`

The student likely chose `d`, "equations though," perhaps due to misunderstanding the need for commas to set apart interrupting elements or simply overlooking the rules of punctuation for such clauses. It's critical in SAT questions to follow the punctuation rules precisely, especially for sentence clarity and proper structure. 

### Explanation to the Student

You should always ensure that interrupting modifiers like "though" are clearly set off with commas. This helps in maintaining the clarity of the sentence and ensures it conforms to Standard English conventions. In this case, "though" provides a contrasting idea and needs to be framed properly with commas.

So, the correctly punctuated sentence is:
"In 1943, in the midst of World War II, mathematics professor Grace Hopper was recruited by the US military to help the war effort by solving complex equations. Hopper’s subsequent career would involve more than just equations, though, as a pioneering computer programmer, Hopper would help usher in the digital age."

Ensuring you understand where and how to correctly use commas for interrupting modifiers will improve sentence clarity and correctness in your writing.
