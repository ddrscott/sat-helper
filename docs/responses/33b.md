To help the student understand why their answer was incorrect and how to approach finding the correct one, let's analyze each choice in detail against the requirement to effectively compare the contributions of Anna Hedgeman and Daisy Bates to the March on Washington:

1. **Option A:**
   - "Hedgeman and Bates contributed to the march in different ways; Bates, for example, delivered a brief but memorable address."
   - This option briefly touches on the difference in their contributions but doesn't explicitly state what Hedgeman did.

2. **Option B:**
   - "Hedgeman worked in politics and helped organize the march, while Bates was a journalist and school desegregation advocate."
   - This option provides general information about their backgrounds but doesn't specifically highlight their contributions to the March on Washington, which is a critical point regarding their roles in the event.

3. **Option C:**
   - "Although Hedgeman worked behind the scenes to make sure a woman speaker was included, Bates was the sole woman to speak at the march."
   - This option directly compares their specific contributions to the March on Washington. It highlights that Hedgeman worked behind the scenes to ensure a woman was included, while Bates was the lone woman who actually spoke at the event. This fits the requirements well.

4. **Option D:**
   - "Many African American women, including Bates and Hedgeman, fought for civil rights, but only one spoke at the march."
   - This option is too broad and slightly off-topic since it's not directly comparing Hedgeman’s and Bates’ contributions, narrowing down to the specific context of the March on Washington.

Given this analysis, **option C** most effectively uses the notes to compare the contributions of Hedgeman and Bates regarding the March on Washington. 

Now, let's consider why the student might have chosen **option B**:
- **Option B** provides factual information about both women’s general backgrounds and career highlights, which might have looked appealing because it includes multiple pieces of relevant information.
- However, it misses specifying their individual contributions to the March on Washington, which was the crux of the question. 

To emphasize to the student, the goal is to ensure that the key contributions of each woman to the March on Washington are clearly compared. This involves recognizing that:
- **Hedgeman** was instrumental behind the scenes in ensuring female representation among the speakers.
- **Bates** was the actual female speaker at the event, making a memorable contribution by addressing the crowd.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C**, as it explicitly highlights and compares their specific roles and contributions to the march itself.
