Let's examine the text more closely to determine the correct answer and understand the student's potential reasoning for choosing `A`.

**Text Analysis:**
From the passage provided, let’s identify key information about Mother:
- She did not spend her time in dull visits to dull ladies, or waiting for dull ladies to visit her.
- She was almost always present, ready to engage with her children.
- She played with them, read to them, and helped them with their homework.
- She wrote stories for them while they were at school, read these stories to them after tea, and created funny poems for their birthdays and other occasions.

**Answer Choices:**
A) She wishes that more ladies would visit her.
B) Birthdays are her favorite special occasion.
C) She creates stories and poems for her children.
D) Reading to her children is her favorite activity.

**Correct Answer:**
Through the text, we see that Mother is very involved with her children’s lives by writing stories and creating poetry for them. This corresponds directly to choice `C`: "She creates stories and poems for her children."

**Incorrect Answer Analysis:**
- A) "She wishes that more ladies would visit her."
  - This is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that she did not spend time on dull visits to ladies or waiting for them to visit. There is nothing in the text that suggests she wishes for more visits from ladies. The word "dull" used repetitively indicates that she did not enjoy such visits.
  
**Possible Reason for Student Choosing A:**
- Misreading or Misinterpretation: The student may have misinterpreted the initial part of the text, thinking that the narrator was lamenting a lack of visits, rather than stating that Mother avoided dull visits altogether.
- Focus on "visits": The repetition of the word "visits" might have caught the student's eye, leading them to incorrectly infer that visits were something Mother desired more of.
  
**Explanation for Correct Choice:**
- The correct choice `C` closely aligns with the examples and details provided about Mother's creative activities for her children: writing stories and making up poems. These examples illustrate her engagement in storytelling and poetry, making `C` a succinct summary of her actions described in the passage.

In guiding your student, emphasize the importance of closely reading and understanding the text details. Encourage them to look for explicit evidence in the passage that directly supports an answer choice.
