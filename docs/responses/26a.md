Let's break down the sentence and identify the correct choice together. The sentence in the question is:

"The classic children’s board game Chutes and Ladders is a version of an ancient Nepalese game, Paramapada Sopanapata. In both games, players encounter “good” or “bad” spaces while traveling along a path; landing on one of the good spaces _______ a player to skip ahead and arrive closer to the end goal."

When determining which verb form to use, we need to focus on subject-verb agreement. Let’s consider each option:

- **A) allows**
- **B) are allowing**
- **C) have allowed**
- **D) allow**

First, identify the subject for the verb in the clause "landing on one of the good spaces _______ a player to skip ahead and arrive closer to the end goal."

The subject here is "landing," which is a gerund (a verb form that functions as a noun). Gerunds are singular, so we must use a singular verb to match. 

- **A) allows**: This is a singular verb and correctly matches the singular subject "landing." This is why the student likely chose this option.
- **B) are allowing**: This is a plural verb phrase and does not match the singular subject. Incorrect.
- **C) have allowed**: This is a past perfect tense and does not match the present tense structure of the sentence. Incorrect.
- **D) allow**: This is a plural verb and does not match the singular subject. Incorrect.

Therefore, the correct choice should be **A) allows**.

Since the correct choice is **A) allows**, it seems like there was a misunderstanding in the original question. **A) allows** is indeed the correct answer because it matches the subject-verb agreement rules in Standard English. If the student chose `a`, they actually answered correctly.
