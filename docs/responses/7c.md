To help your student understand the correct answer, let's go through the text and the answer choices carefully.

The text describes:
1. Luis von Ahn’s work on converting printed books into digital format.
2. The problem von Ahn encountered with distorted words that digital scanners couldn’t recognize.
3. How von Ahn used this problem to create the reCAPTCHA test.
4. The purpose of the reCAPTCHA test: to differentiate humans from automated bots and to aid in the book-digitizing project.

Now, let's review each answer choice:

- **A) To discuss von Ahn’s invention of reCAPTCHA**
  - This choice accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The entire passage revolves around von Ahn's invention, including what led to it, how it works, and what it accomplishes.

- **B) To explain how digital scanners work**
  - This choice is incorrect because the text does not provide a detailed explanation of how digital scanners work. It only mentions that scanners had trouble with distorted words.

- **C) To call attention to von Ahn’s book-digitizing project**
  - While the book-digitizing project is mentioned, it is not the main focus of the text. The project is discussed in the context of how it led to the creation of reCAPTCHA.

- **D) To indicate how popular reCAPTCHA is**
  - This choice is incorrect because the text does not mention the popularity of reCAPTCHA at all.

Your student chose **C** likely because they noticed the book-digitizing project mentioned in the text. However, the key mistake is that they overlooked the fact that the main focus of the text is on the invention of reCAPTCHA and how it addresses the problem von Ahn faced. The mention of the book-digitizing project is supplementary and serves to explain the context in which reCAPTCHA was developed, not the main purpose.

Directing your student’s attention to how each part of the text supports the creation and functionality of reCAPTCHA can help them see why **A** is the correct answer. The passage centers around von Ahn’s innovative solution to a problem, which is the essence of the reCAPTCHA invention.
