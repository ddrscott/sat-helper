Let's analyze the question and possible answers to understand why choice `A` is incorrect and to determine the correct answer.

### Breakdown of the Passage
- The passage discusses how judges explain their legal rulings in judicial opinions.
- It mentions that judges often cite philosophers that support their views.
- Anita L. Allen argues that the strongest opinions consider and rebut objections.
- Therefore, discussing philosophers with conflicting views could...

### Analyzing Choices
Let's look at each answer choice in the context of the argument being made:

**A) allow judges to craft judicial opinions without needing to consult philosophical works.**
- This choice implies that considering conflicting views would help judges avoid philosophical consultations altogether.
- This does not align with the passage’s assertion that considering conflicting views adds strength to the judicial opinions. It also contradicts the idea that judges frequently consult philosophers.

**B) help judges improve the arguments they put forward in their judicial opinions.**
- This choice suggests that addressing conflicting philosophical views can strengthen judges' arguments by making their reasoning more robust and comprehensive.
- This aligns well with Anita L. Allen’s argument that the strongest opinions rebut potential objections and thus improve the quality of the judicial opinions.

**C) make judicial opinions more comprehensible to readers without legal or philosophical training.**
- While making opinions more comprehensible is a useful goal, the passage does not suggest that discussing conflicting philosophical views is intended to make judicial opinions easier for laypeople to understand. The focus is on the strength of the arguments rather than clarity for the general reader.

**D) bring judicial opinions in line with views that are broadly held among philosophers.**
- This choice suggests that the purpose of discussing conflicting philosophies is to align judicial opinions with the consensus among philosophers.
- This is not in line with Allen’s argument that considering opposing views makes judicial opinions stronger through rebuttal rather than alignment.

### Correct Answer and Student's Mistake
The correct answer is:
**B) help judges improve the arguments they put forward in their judicial opinions.**

#### Possible Reasons for the Student Choosing `A`
- Misinterpretation: The student may have misunderstood the passage to mean that considering contrary philosophical views could somehow simplify the process, not realizing that the goal is to strengthen the argument.
- Lack of Focus on Key Points: They might have missed the emphasis on improving the strength and quality of judicial opinions through addressing objections, focusing instead on a perceived convenience.

#### Conclusion
The passage emphasizes that the strongest judicial opinions are those that consider and rebut contrary views. Therefore, discussing conflicting philosophies improves the judges' arguments by addressing potential weaknesses and counterarguments, which is why choice `B` is the correct answer.
