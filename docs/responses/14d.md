Certainly! Let's analyze the question and the provided table to determine which choice most effectively uses the data to complete the example.

### Analysis:

1. **Context of the Example:**
   The example statement ends with “it’s entirely possible, for example, that _______.” This suggests that we're looking for a statement illustrating that the actual number of films credited to each individual might be underestimated due to lost records.

2. **Table Data Review:**

   - **James Young Deer:** 
     - Actor: 33 films
     - Director: 35 films
     - Writer: 10 films

   - **Dark Cloud:** 
     - Actor: 35 films
     - Writer: 1 film

   - **Edwin Carewe:** 
     - Actor: 47 films
     - Director: 58 films
     - Producer: 20 films
     - Writer: 4 films

   - **Lillian St. Cyr (Red Wing):**
     - Actor: 66 films

### Choices Analysis:

- **Choice A:** “Dark Cloud acted in significantly fewer films than did Lillian St. Cyr, who is credited with 66 performances.”
  - This statement is factually accurate based on the table, but it fails to illustrate the possibility of underestimation of the number of films credited. It simply compares the credited totals directly stated in the table.
  
- **Choice B:** “Edwin Carewe’s 47 credited acting roles include only films made after 1934.”
  - This statement is factually incorrect because the table specifies Edwin Carewe’s years active as 1912–1934. Nothing is mentioned about roles after 1934.

- **Choice C:** “Lillian St. Cyr acted in far more than 66 films and Edwin Carewe directed more than 58.”
  - This statement directly addresses the underestimation issue mentioned in the prompt. It suggests that the credited numbers are minimums and the actual totals might be higher due to lost records.

- **Choice D:** “James Young Deer actually directed 33 films and acted in only 10.”
  - This statement conflicts with the data in the table (James Young Deer is credited with 33 films as an actor and 35 as a director). Additionally, it does not contribute to the concept of potential underestimation; rather, it presents hypothetical inaccuracies.

### Correct Answer:
The correct answer is **C**, as it effectively uses the data from the table to illustrate potential underestimation in the credited film counts.

### Possible Reason the Student Chose `D`:
The student might have misinterpreted the function of the example, thinking it required an amendment to the numbers rather than illustrating an underestimation. They might have also confused the specific roles and numbers listed for James Young Deer, leading to a focus on incorrect rearrangement instead of the overall implication about potentially higher actual film credits.
