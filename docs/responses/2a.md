Certainly! Let's analyze the question and the provided answer choices to explain why `a) impartial` is incorrect and to identify the correct answer.

### Context and Clue Analysis
The sentence describes Annie Dodge Wauneka's work starting in the 1950s to promote public health. The key pieces of information include:
1. She "continuously worked."
2. Her effort involved "traveling throughout the vast Navajo homeland."
3. She wrote a "medical dictionary for speakers of Din√© bizaad, the Navajo language."

These clues suggest that her efforts were ongoing, dedicated, and likely required a lot of perseverance and dedication.

### Answer Choices:
- **A) impartial**: This means unbiased or fair. It doesn't fit the context of describing the nature of her continuous work.
- **B) offhand**: This means casual or without careful thought, which doesn't match the description of continuous and dedicated efforts.
- **C) persistent**: This means continuing firmly or obstinately despite difficulties. It aligns well with the context of continuous work and dedication.
- **D) mandatory**: This means required by law or rules, which doesn't fit since her work appears to be voluntary and driven by her dedication.

### Why the Correct Answer is `C`
The term "persistent" precisely and logically fits the description:
- Annie Dodge Wauneka's effort was ongoing (continuous work).
- Her dedication involved substantial and extensive actions (traveling and writing a medical dictionary).

### Why the Student Might Have Chosen `A`
- The student might have interpreted "impartial" to imply a positive attribute of her work (that she was fair and unbiased). 
- They might have overlooked the contextual requirement of describing the consistent and determined nature of her efforts.

### Correct Answer:
The correct answer is `C) persistent`. This word captures the ongoing and dedicated aspect of Annie Dodge Wauneka's work in promoting public health.
