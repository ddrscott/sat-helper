Sure, I can help with that.

First, let's look at the question. We need to determine the function of the underlined sentence in the context of the entire passage.

The underlined sentence is:
> "The landscape outspread below her seemed an enlargement of her present mood, and she found something of herself in its calmness, its breadth, its long free reaches."

Now, let's analyze the context. The sentence before it says:
> "Lily had no real intimacy with nature, but she had a passion for the appropriate and could be keenly sensitive to a scene which was the fitting background of her own sensations."

And the sentence after it says:
> "On the nearer slopes the sugar-maples wavered like pyres of light; lower down was a massing of grey orchards, and here and there the lingering green of an oak-grove."

Now let's examine the choices:
- **A) It creates a detailed image of the physical setting of the scene.**
  - This choice is focused on creating an image of the physical setting. However, this is more applicable to the sentence that follows the underlined one, which describes the sugar-maples, orchards, and oak-grove.
- **B) It establishes that a character is experiencing an internal conflict.**
  - This implies a struggle or conflict within Lily. However, the underlined sentence shows her mood as calm and expansive, and there isn't a sense of conflict presented.
- **C) It makes an assertion that the next sentence then expands on.**
  - This means the underlined sentence presents an idea, and the next sentence provides more details about it.
- **D) It illustrates an idea that is introduced in the previous sentence.**
  - This means the underlined sentence gives an example or description of an idea mentioned in the preceding sentence.

The underlined sentence describes how Lily's mood matches the landscape. The previous sentence talks about how Lily is sensitive to scenes that match her emotions. The underlined sentence is basically illustrating this by describing how she sees the landscape and finds it fitting to her mood. Therefore, choice D is a good match.

Why the student might have chosen `B`:
- `B` mentions "internal conflict" which can be tempting because literary passages often explore characters' struggles. The student might have misinterpreted "present mood" to imply an internal struggle rather than a fitting and harmonious description of Lily's emotional state.

**Correct answer: D) It illustrates an idea that is introduced in the previous sentence.**
