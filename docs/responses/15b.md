To guide the student towards understanding the correct answer, let's break down the process of analyzing the data in the table and the researchers’ claim step by step.

### Understanding the Table
The table lists five species and shows:
1. The number of juvenile plants found on bare ground.
2. The number of juvenile plants found in patches of vegetation.
3. The total number of juvenile plants.
4. The percentage of juvenile plants found in patches of vegetation.

### Researchers' Claim
The researchers claim that juvenile plants of these species gain an advantage when growing close to other plants because only 15% would be in patches of vegetation if plants were randomly distributed. Therefore, they are looking for percentages significantly greater than 15% to support their claim.

### Choices Analysis
A. **For all five species, less than 75% of juvenile plants were growing in patches of vegetation.**
   - This statement is factually correct based on the table, but it does not necessarily support the claim about an advantage gained from proximity to other plants. It's about quantity, not the comparative aspect against randomness.

B. **The species with the greatest number of juvenile plants growing in patches of vegetation was H. stoechas.**
   - This is incorrect. According to the table:
     - H. squamatum has 321
     - T. libanitis has 120
     - H. syriacum has 106
     - T. moroderi has 13
     - H. stoechas has 12
   - Clearly, H. squamatum has the greatest number of juvenile plants in patches of vegetation. Students might choose this option if they quickly scan and misinterpret the data.

C. **For T. libanitis and T. moroderi, the percentage of juvenile plants growing in patches of vegetation was less than what would be expected if plants were randomly distributed.**
   - This is incorrect. For T. libanitis and T. moroderi:
     - Both have 59.1%, which is greater than the 15% expected from random distribution.
 
D. **For each species, the percentage of juvenile plants growing in patches of vegetation was substantially higher than what would be expected if plants were randomly distributed.**
   - This is the correct answer. All percentages (59.1%, 59.1%, 52.7%, 59.6%, and 52.2%) are much higher than the expected 15%. This supports the claim that these species gain an advantage from growing among other plants.

### Why the Student Chose B
The student might have quickly looked at the numbers and mistaken the criteria for the researchers’ claim, focusing on the quantity rather than the percentage in context. They might also have experienced confusion between identifying quantity and interpreting percentage-related data.

### Correct Answer
The correct choice is **D**. Here’s why:
- The researchers’ claim involves plants gaining an advantage by growing in patches of vegetation.
- Given that the expected percentage of plants in patches if distributed randomly is 15%, observing significantly higher percentages for all listed species directly supports this claim.

Encouraging the student to focus on the connection between the data presented and the claim made by the researchers will help them understand why D is the correct answer. It emphasizes understanding and interpreting data in the context of the claim rather than just focusing on quantities or misinterpreted data points.
