The correct answer is A) To praise a certain writer for being especially perceptive regarding people and nature.

### Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Main Purpose of the Text:**
   - The poem is primarily celebrating and praising Paul Laurence Dunbar, highlighting his exceptional ability to understand and articulate human emotions and natural beauty.

2. **Breakdown of the Poem's Content:**
   - "Thou, with stroke of mighty pen, Hast told of joy and mirth, And read the hearts and souls of men As cradled from their birth."
     - The speaker acknowledges Dunbar's powerful writing skills and his profound understanding of human emotions ("joy and mirth" and "the hearts and souls of men").
   - "The language of the flowers, Thou hast read them all, And e’en the little brook Responded to thy call."
     - Here, the speaker praises Dunbar's sensitivity and ability to interpret the subtleties of nature ("language of the flowers" and "the little brook").

3. **Why the Correct Answer is A:**
   - **Choice A** directly states that the text's main purpose is to praise the writer's perceptiveness about people and nature, which aligns perfectly with the poem's focus on Dunbar's understanding and depiction of these elements.
   
4. **Why B is Incorrect:**
   - **Choice B** suggests that the purpose is to show that the writer has read extensively about various topics. However, the poem does not discuss Dunbar’s reading habits or the breadth of his knowledge across different subjects. It focuses on his insightful writing about people and nature.

### Why the Student Might Have Chosen B:
- The student might have misinterpreted phrases like "The language of the flowers, Thou hast read them all" to mean that Dunbar was well-read across various topics.
- Another possibility is that the student didn’t fully grasp the distinction between having read about subjects and being perceptive of them in his writing.
- The student might have focused on the literal wording "hast read" rather than the figurative context of the praise for Dunbar’s perceptiveness.

To help the student better understand, emphasize the need to look at the overarching theme and tone of the passage, which is one of praise for specific attributes (perceptiveness and insight into people and nature), rather than a narration of his reading habits or process. Encourage the student to consider the overall message of the poem and how each line contributes to that message.
